To do so, simply click 'Sign in' in the top right corner of this page, then 'Create account', and follow the prompts to create an account.\n",

You may have to click \"Run Anyway\", if it warns you that the code was not authored by Google. It may take a moment, but you should see a helicopter once it finishes executing. You can use your mouse to move it around and see it from all sides."
