## Usability Heuristics

[These 10 heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) are a good guide for non-designers to find problems in their user interfaces.

**Important points:**

* Not all heuristics may be relevant for a particular application
* Web applications satisfy some heuristics for "free" (e.g. #3 is mostly satisfied by the "back" button)
