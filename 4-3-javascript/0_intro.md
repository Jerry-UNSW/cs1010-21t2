## Javascript

Javascript is a language that runs inside web browsers. It allows web applications to have more "dynamic" behaviour.

**Important points**:
* Javascript is a large and complex language. We won't be covering it in depth, but you can do simple things fairly easily.
* To create complicated dynamic UIs in Javascript you typically need a Javascript framework (e.g. [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), or [Angular](https://angular.io/))

## Answering an important question

* How many students in this course take illegal drugs?
* Create a web form for collecting answers to this question.
* Can we use Javascript to make students more likely to want to fill in the form?
* Assuming we had the results from this survey, how would we get the *real* percentage of students taking illegal drugs?

See `illegal_drugs.py` and `illegal_drugs.js`.
